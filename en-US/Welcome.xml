    <title>Need Help?</title>
    <para>
      There are a number of places you can get assistance should you
      run into problems.
    </para>
    <para>
      If you run into a problem and would like some assistance, go to
      <ulink type="http" url="http://ask.fedoraproject.org" />.  Many
      answers are already there, but if you don't find yours, you can
      simply post a new question.  This has the advantage that anyone
      else with the same problem can find the answer, too.
    </para>
    <para>
      You may also find assistance on the <filename>#fedora</filename>
      channel on the IRC net <filename>irc.freenode.net</filename>.
      Keep in mind that the channel is populated by volunteers wanting
      to help, but folks knowledgeable about a specific topic might not
      always be available.
